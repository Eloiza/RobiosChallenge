## Description
My approach to this code was to make a Naive Bayes based algorithm to compute the probability of someone being infected with Covid-19 based on some given symptoms. First the data is collected based on a form with basic questions. Then all this data is processed by the algorithm and then we get the probability of a possible contamination. To build the algorithm, I have used as parameters two papers that describe statistically the most common symptoms in Brazil. Those can be find by the following references:
